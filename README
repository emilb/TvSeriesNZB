Checkout:
git clone git://github.com/emilb/TvSeriesNZB.git

Compiling:

mvn clean package

Installation:

1. Unpack the bundle in a directory of your choice.
2. Edit tvseriesnzb.conf and enter the URL and apikey to SABnzbd
3. Define the shows you want to follow in shows.xml

Running:

java -jar tvseriesnzb-0.1.jar

Features:

tvseriesnzb automatically searches for new tv shows that have been aired and tells 
SABnzbd to download them. You need an account at newzbin and an installation of
SABnzbd. 

Newzbin is now dead, the program is adapted to use nzbs.org instead.

TODO:
- (DONE) Fix xml for tv, better and fewer search options for quality and format
- Fix search logic to implement new scene rules
- Don't query tvrage for shows that have status Ended
- Add persistent caching (infinispan) for tvrage lookups (update on daily basis)
- Add true search mechanism for shows that aren't found in RSS feed
- Fix code style
- Remove ApplicationContext.xml and use Spring java config instead.
- Change ApplicationSettings to Spring style config?
- Change logging to SLF4J
- Update HTTPClient to v4
- Add startparam to clear cache
- Add startparam to store NZB files to disk instead of sending url:s to sabnzbd
- Change CLI library to jopt-simple
- Refresh this document for instructions and usage
- Add more JUnit 4 tests

Search options in show.xml:

tvseriesnzb uses Newzbin to search for available downloads. You can specify what 
source, format, language and subtitled language you want by adding one or more 
parameters to the SearchSettings tag.

  <Show>
    <Name>Grey&apos;s Anatomy</Name>
    <Season>5</Season>
    <Episode>18</Episode>
    <ID>3741</ID>
    <SearchSettings>
      <Source>HDTV</Source>
      <Format>720p</Format>
      <Format>x264</Format>
      <ExtraSearchParameters>-a:sub~German -a:sub~French -a:sub~Dutch</ExtraSearchParameters>
    </SearchSettings>
  </Show>

In the above example tvseriesnzb will search for episodes with a source of HDTV and in the format
720p or x264. The ExtraSearchParameters ensures that no foreign subtitles are present. You may
add anything you want for ExtraSearchParameters, just make sure that they follow the search rules
at newzbin.
